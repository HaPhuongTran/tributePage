			<h3>Profile</h3>
			<p id="content">Haruki Murakami began his career in writing after he watched a baseball game at the Jingu Stadium one day in 1978. He is one of the most popular, if not the best, novelist the Land of the Rising Sun could offer as his books and stories gained "Bestseller" titles not just in his native country but all around the world. His works have been translated into 50 different languages to cater various readers and sold millions of copies. Aside from fiction and non-fiction stories, he also dabbled with surrealism, magical realism, science fiction, picaresque, and realism among others, making him an impeccable storyteller who is worthy of numerous awards and receiving international recognition, such as the Franz Kafka Prize in 2006 and Jerusalem Prize in 2009.</p>
